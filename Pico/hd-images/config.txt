# This is the configuration file for the Apricot hard drive emulator.
#
# There has to be at least one drive line, drive1
# Drive lines have the format:
#               drive<n>=<filename>,<size>
# Where n is either 1 or 2
# and the size is either 5, 10 or 20 for the size of the virtual drive in megabytes.
#
# If the drive file doesn't exist then an empty drive (with the correct Apricot headers)
# is created.
#
# Don't try to use 20MB images with the Apricot F1 as it assumes that it's a 10MB drive.

drive1=hd0.img,10
drive2=hd1.img,10
#drive1=hd20.img,20
